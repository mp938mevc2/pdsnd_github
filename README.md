### Date created
The Python script was created February 2025 as part of the Udacity Nanodegree [Introduction to Programming for Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

### Project Title
Exploring BikeShare data in three US Cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C..

### Description
The Python script provides snapshots of BikeShare data for the cities of Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C. The data covers the first six months of 2017. The user is requested to input the parameters of city, month, and day of the week to get basic statistice for BikeShare use in the time frame specified.

### Files used
There are three csv files that the Python script calls: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv. The files contain the raw data for the cities' BikeShare programs.

### Credits
The file was created my Tim Frawley as part of the class.
